# raw configure
# even more basic

# .vimrc (vim > neovim, no plugins)
# .bashrc (again minimal)
# .tmux.conf (maybe created from bashrc?)
# bashrc should set the defaults for the rest of the experience with the exception of vimrc
# so we just need to copy 2 files
# - vimrc for the editor
# - bashrc for the entire environment

# check for cli tools (e.g rustc? grep?)

# default colorschemes in vim
# although vim 9? and later provide retrobox which is superawesome, we don't have that on more legacy setups
# so vim 7 is the oldest we support which has
# desert (..pretty good but hate blue comments, kinda gruvbox-esque)
# evening
# industry (yeah.. this is pretty neat.)
# pablo (dark blue usage too much, similar to industry but worse)
# peachpuff
# slate (too muted)
# HOWEVER ---
# vim colorschemes aren't consistent
# ideally have something that works regardless of background (pure black/dark grey)
# COLORTERM, TERM settings, termguicolors, t_Co
# optional nuclear option, set colorscheme and then:
# highlight Normal ctermbg=NONE
# highlight nonText ctermbg=NONE
# it seems Windows Terminal/Powershell SSH

# termguicolors seems _pretty_ compatible





# LSCOLORS & GREPCOLORS
